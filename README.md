    "require": {
        "m6web/redis-mock": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

Update your vendors :

```
$ composer update m6web/redis-mock
```

## Functions

**FLUSHDB**                                      | Flushes the database

It mocks **MULTI**, **DISCARD** and **EXEC** commands but without any transaction behaviors, they just make the interface fluent and return each command results.
**PIPELINE** and **EXECUTE** pseudo commands (client pipelining) are also mocked.  

## Usage

RedisMock library provides a factory able to build a mocked class of your Redis library that can be directly injected in your application :

```php
$factory          = new \M6Web\Component\RedisMock\RedisMockFactory();
$myRedisMockClass = $factory->getAdapterClass('My\Redis\Library');
$myRedisMock      = new $myRedisMockClass($myParameters);
```

In a simpler way, if you don't need to instanciate the mocked class with custom parameters (e.g. to easier inject the mock using Symfony config file), you can use `getAdapter` instead of `getAdapterClass` to directly create the adapter :

```php
$factory     = new \M6Web\Component\RedisMock\RedisMockFactory();
$myRedisMock = $factory->getAdapter('My\Redis\Library');
```

**WARNING !**

  * *RedisMock doesn't implement all Redis features and commands. The mock can have undesired behavior if your parent class uses unsupported features.*
  * *Storage is static and therefore shared by all instances.*

*Note : the factory will throw an exception by default if your parent class implements unsupported commands. If you want even so partially use the mock, you can specify the second parameter when you build it `$factory->getAdapter('My\Redis\Library', true)`. The exception will then thrown only when the command is called.*

### Static storage & Multiple servers
The storage in the RedisMock class is organized by named areas. The default area's name is the empty string `''` but you can
specify an alternate area name when calling the factory's `getAdapter` method.

````php
getAdapter($classToExtend, $failOnlyAtRuntime = false, $ignoreConstructor = true, $storage = '')
````

 This enables the mocking of several remote Redis servers, each one with its own storage area.

 However, one same area remains statically shared across all the instances bound to it.

## Tests

The development environment is provided by Vagrant and the [Xotelia box](https://github.com/Xotelia/VagrantBox).

```shell
$ cp Vagrantfile.dist Vagrantfile
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

```shell
$ cd /vagrant
$ composer install
$ ./vendor/bin/atoum
```
